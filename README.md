# OS Kernel Subsystem
In my bachelor studies, I undertook a project that involved creating a kernel subsystem responsible for efficient thread management. This subsystem also included semaphores to synchronize processes and respond to keyboard events.

Thread Management:
I engineered a robust kernel subsystem that orchestrated thread creation, scheduling, and coordination, enabling effective multitasking.

Semaphores for Synchronization:
The subsystem incorporated semaphores to manage shared resources among threads, enhancing system stability by preventing conflicts.

Keyboard Event Responsiveness:
Furthermore, the subsystem interacts with keyboard events, ensuring a swift and seamless response to user input.
