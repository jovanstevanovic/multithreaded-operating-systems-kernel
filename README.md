# OS Kernel Subsystem

Thread Management:
I engineered a robust kernel subsystem that orchestrated thread creation, scheduling, and coordination, enabling
effective multitasking.

Semaphores for Synchronization:
The subsystem incorporated semaphores to manage shared resources among threads, enhancing system stability by preventing
conflicts.

Keyboard Event Responsiveness:
Furthermore, the subsystem interacts with keyboard events, ensuring a swift and seamless response to user input.
